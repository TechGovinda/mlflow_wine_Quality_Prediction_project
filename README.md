# mlflow_wine_Quality_Prediction_project
This project leverages MLflow to track and manage the machine learning lifecycle for predicting wine quality. The dataset used is the Wine Quality Dataset, which contains physicochemical properties of red and white wines, along with their quality ratings. The project follows an end-to-end ML workflow, including data preprocessing, model
